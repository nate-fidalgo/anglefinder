measure angles with your phone
<p>
Please note i coded this intentionally only to do the roll , pitch but we technically could also have displayed the yaw of the phone as well.
I found it not so useful for a phone to include it. But perhaps in newer versions all easily add one more display for the yaw to get all 
3dimensional sides of motion of a phone. Though normally construction workers would only need to tilt the phone in the x or y directions or both directions to measure flatness or a certain angle they want to know about.
