This is an anglefinder android app created from the Android Studios IDE allowing you to figure out angles/slopes with your phone. <p>
It uses git VCS built-in to the Android Studios to push to this remote github site. So all the internal Android Studio IDE file should also be pushed up to Github. <p> Unless ofcourse it was excluded in a gitignore file or similar files that are excluded by git.
<p> So basically one should easily beable to clone this master branch down to there Android Studio IDE or an IDE compatible with Android Studios to add-on / work on / customize / build and deploy to there phone. Enjoy its nice to beable to measure any angles just with your phone.
<p> A construction lovers tool
